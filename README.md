This is a basic tutorial for using the software [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/). It uses and modifies the notebook [Basic Tutorial: Qubit Rotation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/tutorial/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html). Our version is for instructional purposes and will be included in a YouTube tutorial introducing quantum machine learning to people with minimal coding, mathematics, and physics experience.
